At Saturday 15th Dec, change the following parts of your config:

<relay>
	<server>stream0.r-a-d.io</server>
	<port>8000</port>
</relay>

If you dont, your relay will stop working, or will start relaying another relay instead of the master server.

Side-effect of this: your relay will now get triple or more the usual traffic.
A bonus of having more relays means that the more relays there are, the less traffic you get.

However, i have seeded this so that the loadbalancer favours the two most stable servers above others:
         current / database      random jitter       database priority
ratio = (listeners / limit) + (1/(15000 to 20000) - (priority / 1000)


Location-based loadbalancing is on my TODO list.
